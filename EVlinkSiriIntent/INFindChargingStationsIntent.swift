/*!
 @brief Protocol to declare support for handling an INSendMessageIntent
 @abstract By implementing this protocol, a class can provide logic for resolving, confirming and handling the intent.
 @discussion The minimum requirement for an implementing class is that it should be able to handle the intent. The resolution and confirmation methods are optional. The handling method is always called last, after resolving and confirming the intent.
